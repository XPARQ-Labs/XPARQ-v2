# XPARQ

**XPARQ** is an experimental post-quantum Layer 1 blockchain written in Rust.

The project is organized around a small set of components:

- `crypto` — cryptographic primitives and post-quantum signature support
- `kernel` — consensus, ledger, transactions, native coin, and Program execution integration
- `extension` — application layer for XPQ transfers and asset operations
- `runtime` — node, P2P networking, synchronization, storage, mining, and RPC
- `wallet` — local wallet and CLI
- `docs` — protocol and RPC documentation
- `depend` — vendored or project-pinned dependencies

> [!WARNING]
> XPARQ is under active development. Protocol rules, database formats, networking, wallet formats, and APIs may change. Do not use funds or keys that you cannot afford to lose.

## Requirements

XPARQ currently requires:

- Git
- Rust **1.90 or newer**
- Cargo
- A supported 64-bit operating system

On Debian/Ubuntu, install common build tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git curl build-essential pkg-config
```

Install Rust with `rustup` if it is not already installed:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XPARQ-Labs/XPARQ.git
cd XPARQ
```

## Build

Build the node and wallet in release mode:

```bash
cargo build --release -p node -p wallet
```

The binaries will be available at:

```text
target/release/node
target/release/wallet
```

For development builds:

```bash
cargo build -p node -p wallet
```

## Run a node

### Mainnet

Mainnet is the default feature.

After building:

```bash
./target/release/node
```

This is equivalent to starting the automatic node runtime with the default mainnet configuration.

Default mainnet settings:

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Data directory | `./data/mainnet` |
| P2P listen | `0.0.0.0:6677` |
| RPC listen | `127.0.0.1:6666` |
| Mining | Disabled |

A normal startup will print information similar to:

```text
database: ./data/mainnet
rpc: http://127.0.0.1:6666
outbound_peers: 0
mining: disabled
```

Stop the node with:

```text
Ctrl+C
```

### Run with an explicit peer

To connect to another XPARQ node:

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --peer <IP_OR_HOSTNAME:PORT>
```

Connect to the XPARQ mainnet DDNS bootstrap node (IPv6 connectivity required):

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --peer xparqnode.duckdns.org:6677
```

The hostname follows the bootstrap node's changing IPv6 address. It is resolved
on each connection attempt. Bootstrap peers must be supplied explicitly; the
default startup does not automatically connect to this hostname.

See [IPv6 and DDNS networking](docs/IPV6_DDNS.md) for IPv6 listener settings,
public address advertisement, and hostname discovery.

Multiple peers can be provided:

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --peer 203.0.113.10:6677 \
  --peer 203.0.113.11:6677
```

### Custom data directory

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --data /path/to/xparq-data
```

Example:

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --data "$HOME/.xparq/mainnet"
```

### Custom P2P and RPC addresses

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --p2p '[::]:6677' \
  --rpc '[::]:6666'
```

`[::]:6666` listens on all IPv6 interfaces. Restrict RPC access with firewall
rules to the clients that need it. For local requests, use `http://[::1]:6666`;
remote clients use `http://[PUBLIC_IPV6]:6666` or
`http://xparqnode.duckdns.org:6666` when RPC is enabled and reachable there.

## Run a mining node

Mining requires an XPARQ address.

First create a wallet:

```bash
./target/release/wallet new
```

Or open the interactive wallet:

```bash
./target/release/wallet
```

The wallet will display an address after creation.

Start the node with mining enabled:

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --miner <XPARQ_ADDRESS>
```

Example:

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --miner YOUR_XPARQ_ADDRESS
```

You can combine mining with peers:

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --peer xparqnode.duckdns.org:6677 \
  --miner <XPARQ_ADDRESS>
```

When mining is active, the node prints:

```text
mining: enabled on the local canonical tip
```

Mining rewards are assigned to the address supplied through `--miner`.

## Public node

A node that accepts incoming P2P connections should expose its P2P port.

Default mainnet P2P port:

```text
6677/TCP
```

If using UFW:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 6677/tcp
```

Do **not** expose the RPC port to the public internet unless you understand the security implications.

To listen for RPC connections on IPv6, explicitly pass:

```text
--rpc '[::]:6666'
```

Without this option, the default RPC listener remains `127.0.0.1:6666`.

### Advertise a public address

If the machine has a directly reachable public IP:

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --public-addr <PUBLIC_IP:6677>
```

Example:

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --public-addr 203.0.113.20:6677
```

### Advertise a DDNS hostname

If your public IPv6 changes, advertise your own DDNS hostname instead of an IP
literal. For the operator of the XPARQ DDNS bootstrap node:

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --p2p '[::]:6677' \
  --rpc '[::]:6666' \
  --public-addr xparqnode.duckdns.org:6677
```

Other node operators should substitute their own hostname. Configure an external
DDNS updater to keep its AAAA record current. The node preserves and shares the
hostname through peer storage and discovery, resolves it again on reconnect,
and refreshes its advertised public IP fallbacks every 60 seconds. See
[IPv6 and DDNS networking](docs/IPV6_DDNS.md).

### Automatic NAT traversal

XPARQ can attempt to map its P2P listener through a compatible NAT gateway:

```bash
./target/release/node run \
  --nat-traversal
```

`--public-addr` and `--nat-traversal` are mutually exclusive.

## RPC

The default mainnet RPC endpoint is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:6666
```

Check node status:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:6666/status
```

Pretty-print with `jq`:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:6666/status | jq
```

Check the fee policy:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:6666/fee-policy | jq
```

Get recent blocks:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:6666/blocks/latest | jq
```

Query a block by height:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:6666/block/0 | jq
```

Query a balance:

```bash
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:6666/balance/<XPARQ_ADDRESS>" | jq
```

### RPC documentation

While the node is running, open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:6666/docs
```

The raw OpenAPI document is available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:6666/openapi.json
```

## Wallet

Start the interactive wallet:

```bash
./target/release/wallet
```

The current interactive menu includes:

```text
XPARQ Wallet
1. Create Wallet
2. Import Wallet
3. Show Address
4. Show Balance
5. Transaction History
6. UTXO
7. Transfer
8. Consolidate UTXOs
9. Explorer
10. Program Assets
11. Deploy Program
12. Exit
```

### Create a wallet

Interactive:

```bash
./target/release/wallet
```

Or CLI:

```bash
./target/release/wallet new
```

The default wallet file is:

```text
wallet.json
```

A custom wallet path can be supplied:

```bash
./target/release/wallet new \
  --wallet my-wallet.json
```

By default, wallet creation uses the `mldsa44` signature account.

Available signature accounts currently include:

```text
mldsa44
mldsa65
mldsa87
```

Example:

```bash
./target/release/wallet new \
  --account mldsa44 \
  --wallet wallet.json
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Back up the mnemonic shown during wallet creation. Anyone with access to the mnemonic may be able to control the wallet.

### Show wallet address

```bash
./target/release/wallet address \
  --wallet wallet.json
```

### Show balance

With the mainnet RPC running locally:

```bash
./target/release/wallet balance \
  --wallet wallet.json \
  --rpc 127.0.0.1:6666
```

## Network modes

XPARQ currently defines separate Cargo features for:

- `mainnet`
- `testnet`
- `devnet`

Only one network mode should be selected for a build.

### Mainnet

Mainnet is enabled by default:

```bash
cargo build --release -p node -p wallet
```

Defaults:

```text
P2P: 0.0.0.0:6677
RPC: 127.0.0.1:6666
Data: ./data/mainnet
```

### Testnet

Build:

```bash
cargo build --release \
  -p node \
  -p wallet \
  --no-default-features \
  --features testnet
```

Defaults:

```text
P2P: 0.0.0.0:16677
RPC: 127.0.0.1:16666
Data: ./data/testnet
```

Run:

```bash
./target/release/node
```

### Devnet

Build:

```bash
cargo build --release \
  -p node \
  -p wallet \
  --no-default-features \
  --features devnet
```

Defaults:

```text
P2P: 0.0.0.0:26677
RPC: 127.0.0.1:26666
Data: ./data/devnet
```

Run:

```bash
./target/release/node
```

#### Experimental litep2p devnet transport

Install `protoc` (the Protocol Buffers compiler) before building `litep2p`.
This transport uses its own protocol and port; legacy TCP peers cannot connect to it.

```bash
cargo build -p node --no-default-features --features litep2p-devnet
./target/debug/node litep2p ./data/devnet-litep2p 127.0.0.1:27677
```

For the normal node with RPC and optional mining, use `node run --litep2p`
with `--data`, `--p2p`, `--rpc`, and `--peer ADDRESS@PEER_ID` as needed.

The node prints its persistent litep2p peer ID. To connect another devnet node,
pass `ADDRESS@PEER_ID`, for example:

```bash
./target/debug/node litep2p ./data/devnet-litep2p-2 127.0.0.1:27678 \
  127.0.0.1:27677@<first-node-peer-id>
```

The litep2p transport validates the genesis and chain-spec hashes during
notification handshake. It verifies a peer's header branch and cumulative
work, downloads matching blocks, and applies the same fork-choice and reorg
logic as the legacy transport. It also relays new blocks and mempool transactions.
Its devnet protocol names are `/xparq/devnet/blocks/2` and
`/xparq/devnet/announce/2`.

## Node commands

Show available commands:

```bash
./target/release/node --help
```

Current node commands include:

```text
node run
node network
node rpc
node p2p-listen
node peer
node info
node check
node account
node mempool
node mine-block
node submit-transaction
node submit-deploy
node submit-block
node version
```

`DeployProgram` can be submitted as canonical Borsh `AuthorizedDeployProgram`
bytes with `node submit-deploy [data-dir] <hex>` or `POST /program/deploy`
(`application/octet-stream`). `POST /program/deploy/quote` accepts the same
structure before signing and returns the next-block program ID, exact protocol
burn, and authorization commitment. The owner signs the commitment and pays
the quoted burn plus a relay fee. The operation mempool persists deploys and
the miner includes them in blocks. The wallet can build and sign deploys:

```bash
wallet program-deploy --code program.xpvm --nonce 1 --wallet wallet.json --rpc 127.0.0.1:6666
```

The wallet selects available coin inputs, obtains the exact protocol burn,
calculates the miner fee, signs the final payment and submits it. Use
`--offline` to print the signed Borsh hex instead. The interactive wallet menu
also has **Deploy Program**. `program-register` creates an asset through a
ProgramCall; it is separate from bytecode deployment.

A lower-level Rust payload builder is in
[`runtime/examples/deploy_program.rs`](runtime/examples/deploy_program.rs). With
a funded ML-DSA-44 account and a running RPC node:

```bash
printf '5850564d01010000000000000001070000000000000003' | xxd -r -p > program.xpvm
cargo run -p node --example deploy_program -- \
  127.0.0.1:RPC_PORT owner-seed.hex COIN_SHARE INPUT_ZENO 1 program.xpvm deploy.borsh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:RPC_PORT/program/deploy \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' --data-binary @deploy.borsh
```

The seed file contains 64 hex characters for the account's 32-byte signing
seed. `COIN_SHARE` and `INPUT_ZENO` identify one unreserved coin shown by
`node account`; `program.xpvm` is XPVM bytecode. The example requests the burn
quote, pays a 100,000 zeno miner fee, signs the final payment, and writes the
canonical Borsh payload. Keep the signing seed file private.

### Network information

```bash
./target/release/node info
```

This prints network-level identifiers such as:

- genesis hash
- chain specification hash
- P2P protocol version
- proof-of-work algorithm
- difficulty algorithm

### Check database

```bash
./target/release/node check
```

Or specify a data directory:

```bash
./target/release/node check /path/to/xparq-data
```

### Local ledger snapshots

The node writes a ledger snapshot every 1,000 blocks and after a sync that
applies at least 1,000 blocks. It retains the two newest snapshots. On startup,
the node verifies a snapshot against the local canonical block log, restores
ledger state and rollback journals, then replays blocks after the snapshot.
If no stored snapshot matches, it replays the chain from genesis. New snapshots use version 3. The loader also accepts the legacy version 1
representation when decoding and chain/schema checks succeed; version 2 is not
accepted. A snapshot must match chain identity, checksum and canonical state.
The canonical block log remains required for startup and reorganization.

### Inspect mempool

```bash
./target/release/node mempool
```

### Inspect an account

```bash
./target/release/node account \
  ./data/mainnet \
  <XPARQ_ADDRESS>
```

## Useful development commands

### Coin spends and Program assets

The kernel owns native XPQ and asset types, checked monetary state, and UTXOs.
XPQ transfers execute in the extension application through a restricted kernel
coin host; spend data cannot mutate
the ledger directly. Wallet spends and consolidation use XPQ Program 0, method 1.
Assets live in kernel-owned Program state
and use the wallet `program-*` commands. The `extension` crate depends on
`kernel` and implements the applications on its restricted host interfaces.
Runtime installs `extension::SystemApplications` for validation and execution;
kernel owns authorization, monetary checks, state roots and rollback. One Program signature binds the asset
operation and its XPQ payment. Legacy asset transactions, combined spends and
`asset-*` commands have been removed.

See [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for source ownership and the distinction
between extension applications and deployed [XPVM programs](docs/XPVM.md).
The [VM roadmap](ROADMAP.md) records implementation and open verification gates.

See [ProgramCall integration](docs/PROGRAM_CALL.md) for registration, mint,
transfer, burn and consolidation instructions.

All XPQ Program calls carry `CoinTransition` with `CoinCharges { miner_fee }`.
The miner fee is
credited to the block miner as a separate UTXO; it is no longer encoded as a
normal coin output. The protocol burn remains the verified difference between
XPQ inputs, address outputs, and the miner fee. This changes transaction bytes
and derived output IDs. Start upgraded nodes with fresh chain storage after the
planned chain reset.
Coin outputs encode the recipient address directly; the obsolete block-miner
recipient tag is no longer part of a spend output.

The reset baseline uses chain spec version 1 and storage schema 10. Start with
fresh compatible storage; old assets and transactions are not migrated.
